 Summary: We declare all the properties related to the entity with associated type, the property also need to be declared with @NSManaged keyword for the compiler to understand that this property will use Core Data at its backing store.
     We also create a simple function that maps a JSON Dictionary property and assign it to the properties of Film Managed Object.
